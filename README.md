ColorBanners
======

*Colorize your banners and lockscreen notifications.*

This tweak allows you to improve the look of your notifications by coloring them to match the app icon.
Also included is an option to just use a constant color (thanks to [libcolorpicker](https://bitbucket.org/pixelfiredev/libcolorpicker/)).

Note that this version of the tweak does require ColorBadges.

This tweak was built with help from:

* [TinyBar](https://github.com/alexzielenski/TinyBar)
* [InspectiveC](https://github.com/DavidGoldman/InspectiveC)
